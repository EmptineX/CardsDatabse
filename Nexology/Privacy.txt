Nexology – Privacy Policy

Last updated: (add date)

Nexology respects user privacy and is designed to operate responsibly and ethically.

1. Data Collection

Nexology only collects the minimum data required to function properly, such as server IDs, channel IDs, user IDs, and command usage. No unnecessary or sensitive personal data is collected.

2. Data Usage

Collected data is used solely to provide Nexology’s features, including moderation, protection, and security functions. Data is not used for tracking, profiling, or advertising.

3. Data Sharing

Nexology does not sell, trade, or share collected data with third parties, except when required by law or to comply with Discord’s policies.

4. Data Storage

Data is stored securely and retained only for as long as necessary for operational purposes. Data may be removed upon bot removal or request where applicable.

5. User Control

Server owners maintain control over Nexology’s configuration and usage within their servers. Removing the bot stops further data collection for that server.

6. Children’s Privacy

Nexology does not knowingly collect data from users under the age required by Discord’s Terms of Service.

7. Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time. Continued use of Nexology indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
